Maybe it is not so much about what I want but more about experiencing that which is now.
Maybe that what is is coloured by our individual human experience.
Maybe our individual experience can be influence by a change in *frequency*.
Maybe the truth is colourless.

I don't know what to think or what to feel. What am I to do? I don't have to do anything and soon as this thought is created it creates an impact like a meteor striking the earth's surface. The blast wipes my mind clean from any other thought. But as soon as earth's gravity keeps the stone to its rocky skin the dust falls back to the ground, and so do my other thoughts. At some moments the period of clarity continues longer then at other times. Like one astroid is not the same size as the ones before it, or the ones after it.

what I call myself is nothing but a leaf falling near a body of flowing water. The tree is my upbringing, my culture. the river symbolises time. Times gets me places, it shows me around. Everything influences the path the leaf travels until it finally stops moving on the bottom of the body of water. Then time got the best of it, it doesn't move again and becomes the fundament for the river to change its shape. How little or big the leaf had been, they all shaped the river to its current form. A leaf cannot change itas direction once it lands on the water. And it cannot come out of the water once it is swallowed by it. The brief period the leaf falls from the air to the water is like the freedom a child experiences. But is it wise for a leaf to think upon those days with bittersweetness? For it cannot ever escape the water. As is it wise for the leaf in mid-air to wish it was already in the water? Because it cannot change it's weight, nor the wind. So instead I just smile. I smile at the prospect of the wind being able to change directions in an instant and so does the water. I will never see the same thing twice, this can be both suffocating and liberating.
