<p style="padding: 0 7em 2em 0; border-width: 2px; border-color: #2b0a78; border-style: dotted; color: 'purple'; font-family: 'Consolas';"> Knowing things, making decisions and acting means one is assuming a set of facts to be true.  The Gospel of Doubt can only go so far. Some practical things in this practical reality need to be taken for granted. To assume these things to be true it is easier to act and decide what to do next.</p>

<p class="text-info">* Tomorrow there will be another day. </p>

<p class="lead">* Life will go on.</p>

<p style="color: red; font-family: 'Calibri';"> This is what I call being realistic, even though these things might stop being true at one point in time. </p>

<p style="color: #f2cf4a; font-family: 'Consolas'; font-size: 2em;">To doubt these things, leads often to an endless stream of thoughts that end in <abbr>nowhere-land</abbr> with the only result being the urge to go to sleep and never wake up. </p>
